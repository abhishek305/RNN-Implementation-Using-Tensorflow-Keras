# RNN-Implementation-Using-Tensorflow-Keras
In this initially we will use the deafault keras datasets for creating thee rnn.
After importing the libraries it will initially download the dataset for google and later go for the actually implementation .
This is just a small demo or example how a rnn ka be implemented.
